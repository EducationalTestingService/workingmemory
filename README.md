# workingmemory #
This program tests one's working memory capacity for sequences of numbers or letters. The items in the sequence are displayed over time, which one is asked to recall in order.

This tool has many configuration options. Trials can be of any length. Sequences may recalled either forward or backward. Users can receive feedback (or not). Trials may end when logical conditions are met. 

Check out the configuration tool (config.html) to play with these options.

## Requirements ##
* jQuery (tested with 1.11.3, likely works with any version) 
* bacon.js (included. works with v1 and v2, may work with v3)
